# Fractal-App

A basic desktop app for rendering, viewing and exploring selected fractals, including the [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) and some [Julia sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set).

Features include supersampling and support for rendering on multiple threads.

The aim of this project is for me to learn more about Java and producing basic software. As such, it is rather rough around the edges and very much a work in progress.
